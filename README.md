# Praxis

I was in the process of working out a minimal command-line utility/markdown file-based Getting Things Done setup for myself with the name Praxis. I was using it for a fresh (paid) project. That project fell through and I got distracted, seems I never commited or backed up the bits I'd put together.

So for now at least, this space can be a backup of my todo lists, set up for the [Diced](https://dannyayers.wordpress.com/2015/05/11/getting-things-diced/) decision making algorithm.
